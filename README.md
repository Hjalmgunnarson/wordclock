# Wordclock
ESP32 based DIY wordclock project

TL;DR: check out this :sparkles:[demo video](https://youtu.be/WF_X5soabm0) :sparkles:

<br/>
<img src="images/logo.svg" width="200" align="left">Another take on the classic DIY word clock. This one requires a laser cutter but promises a very clean result and is quite cheap to make (about 50 €) while being feature packed with its 11x10 RGB LED matrix, RTC module (time setting survives power loss), light sensor, WiFi connectivity and more. 

This project was designed for the tools available in our makerspace. The largest square that can be cut in an Epilog Mini laser cutter is approximately 30x30cm, so the clock is designed around that constraint.

## Project overview

### Hardware 

Building the clock from scratch involves mostly laser cutting and soldering. It is not technically challenging if you have basic soldering skills (and access to a laser cutter), but it does take time on both fronts. The project's hardware can be broken down in 3 major elements:

- __The faceplate__ is a glass panel from a cheap picture frame, that is spray painted on its back, then laser etched to mark the letters. The templates and instructions are located in [the faceplate subdirectory](hardware/faceplate/README.md).
- __The frame__ is a sandwich of laser-cut MDF boards. If could also be done with CEC or 3d printing. It holds everything together and most importantly the LED matrix. It has little wells for each LED to channel the light to the letters on the faceplate. The templates and assembly instructions are located in [the frame subdirectory](hardware/frame/README.md).
- __The electronics__ revolve around a WiFI enabled ESP32 development board and a matrix of 114 LEDs made from an LED strip. There is also an RTC module to keep track of time, and a light sensor (LDR). The schematics and instructions for assembly are located in [the electronics subdirectory](hardware/electronics/README.md).

You can oviously choose to customize any of the provided templates to eg create a different faceplate, or adapt the frame to your specific needs (change the LED layout, add extra sensors, etc).

#### Nodo clock

Alternatively, [nodo-shop.nl](https://nodo-shop.nl) developed and sells [a kit](https://www.nodo-shop.nl/en/52-wordclock) that is fully compatible with the software side of this project. 

The kit includes a 3D-printed faceplate (EN, FR and NL versions available) and custom circuit board, is very simple to assemble and requires no soldering.

### Software

The provided [source code](software/README.md) is using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and Arduino IDE. Here's a [demo video](https://youtu.be/WF_X5soabm0) (from v1.0, does not show all current features).

It runs a web server though a WiFi captive portal for initial configuration via a smartphone or computer, then optionally connects to your home network to use internet time (NTP), MQTT client for home automation, and other features. Check out the [User's Manual](software/UsersManual.md) for more details.

</p>

It is, of course, possible to ditch that code entirely and use [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) or [MicroPython](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html) instead.
